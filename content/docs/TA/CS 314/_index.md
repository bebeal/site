# CS 314: Data Structures

---

Hi, I'm Noah and I'm (most likely, if you're on this page) going to be your CS 314 TA for this semester (Spring 2021), which I am very much looking forward to. I'll use this section of my website to provide you all with updates and/or any materials that I think would you would find useful. CS 314 can be tough but luckily for you all, you get to take it with Mike, who truly is an excellent professor. Well, I'm always here if you have any questions, my lab hours are highlighted below as well as my contact information.

## IntelliJ Inspection Profile

Here are my IntelliJ Inspection Profile that I use for CS 314. I recently change some settings so let me know if it throws warnings for hygienically correct code. 

Note: This will not catch all style issues with your code, it just checks for some basic/common semantics that one should follow. (i.e. just because you don't have warnings doesn't mean you won't lose style points!)
